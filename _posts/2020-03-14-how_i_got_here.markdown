3 years ago I was working towards my undergraduate degree in International Relations, while working full-time at a background screening company as a Compliance associate in downtown Cleveland. Like many young, working students, I was anxious to start my career but also somewhat lost and confused. Although I enjoyed my job and my chosen major, I wouldn't say I was passionate about either. I walked to my car after work one day and happened to run into my co-worker and friend. We never run into each other or get an opportunity to talk much, but he asked about how school and work was going, and I asked the same of him. He just came back from a trip to Japan, and I commented on how fun his trip seemed and that I wish I had the freedom to not only travel like he did, but work from anywhere in the world. 

"Well, why can't you?" was his response. 

I didn't have an answer for him. He proceeded to tell me about a coding bootcamp in the area that half of our company's IT department graduated from, and I had absolutely no idea. I assumed that they all had degrees in IT or computer science, and coding bootcamps were a foreign concept to me. I had no exposure to IT or coding of any sort, and he was the first person to really introduce me to the possibility of a career in tech. 

After multiple orientation sessions, various conversations with bootcamp grads, and professors at my University, I applied to the program and was accepted. Unfortunately, I chose to pursue another career and withdrew from the program without ever taking a class. 

As of a month ago, I made the decision to pursue the Self-Paced Software Engineering Program at Flatiron. The program is challenging, but I know that this is the right path for me and the only regret I have is that I didn't start sooner.
